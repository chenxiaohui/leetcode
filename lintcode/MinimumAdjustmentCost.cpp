/*
Given an integer array, adjust each integers so that the difference of every adjcent integers are not greater than a given number target.If the array before adjustment is A, the array after adjustment is B, you should minimize the sum of |A[i]-B[i]| 
Note
You can assume each number in the array is a positive integer and not greater than 100


Example
Given [1,4,2,3] and target=1, one of the solutions is [2,3,2,3], the adjustment cost is 2 and it's minimal. Return 2.

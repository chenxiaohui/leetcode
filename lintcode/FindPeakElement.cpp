/*
There is an integer array which has the following features:    * The numbers in adjacent positions are different.     * A[0] < A[1] && A[A.length - 2] > A[A.length - 1].We define a position P is a peek if A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1].Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.
Note
The array may contains multiple peeks, find any of them.


Example
[1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]
return index 1 (which is number 2)  or 6 (which is number 7)


Challenge

Time complexity O(logN)

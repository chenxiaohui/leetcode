/*
Given two strings, find the longest comment subsequence (LCS).Your code should return the length of LCS.
Example
For "ABCD" and "EDCA", the LCS is "A" (or D or C), return 1
For "ABCD" and "EACB", the LCS is "AC", return 2


Clarification

What's the definition of Longest Common Subsequence?
    * The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two). (Note that a subsequence is different from a substring, for the terms of the former need not be consecutive terms of the original sequence.) It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of file comparison programs such as diff, and has applications in bioinformatics.

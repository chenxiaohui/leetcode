/*
Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.
Example
        4
    /     \
  3         7
          /     \
        5         6
For 3 and 5, the LCA is 4.
For 5 and 6, the LCA is 7.
For 6 and 7, the LCA is 7.

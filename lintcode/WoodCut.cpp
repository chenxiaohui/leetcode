/*
Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.
Note
You couldn't cut wood into float length.

Example
For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.

Challenge

O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.

/*
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
Note
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are mand n respectively.


Example
A = [1, 2, 3, empty, empty] B = [4,5]
After merge, A will be filled as [1,2,3,4,5]

/*
There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example
For A = [1,2,3,4,5,6] B = [2,3,4,5], the median is 3.5
For A = [1,2,3] B = [4,5], the median is 3
 


Challenge

Time Complexity O(logn)
